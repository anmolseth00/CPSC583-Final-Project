# CPSC 583 Final Project

This repository contains the code and data for a project focused on predicting RNA degradation rates at the nucleotide level using graph-based deep learning methods. Our work builds on datasets and concepts from the [Stanford COVID-19 Vaccine competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine), [Eternaâ€™s OpenVaccine challenges](https://eternagame.org/challenges/10845741), and [Combinatorial optimization of mRNA structure, stability, and translation for RNA-based therapeutics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28776-w). By integrating modern graph neural network architectures, transformer-style attention, pretraining strategies, and extensive hyperparameter tuning, we aim to advance the state of the art in RNA stability prediction by directly modeling sequence and structure.

## Repository Structure

- **raw_data/**:  
  Contains raw input files, including the Stanford COVID-19 Vaccine dataset and other experiment data.  
  See the `raw_data/README.md` for detailed descriptions of data sources and experimental conditions.

- **architecture_experiments/**:  
  Implements and compares different GNN-based architectures, including baseline GCN, advanced GAT, hybrid GNN+XGBoost, and a pretrain-then-supervised transformer GNN approach.  
  See `architecture_experiments/README.md` for a summary of each model and the associated results.

- **hyperparameter_optimization/**:  
  Contains scripts and logs for performing hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.  
  See `hyperparameter_optimization/README.md` for instructions and details on the optimization process.

- **results/**:  
  Stores training curves, best model checkpoints, and logs from various runs.

- **tmp/**:  
  A scratch directory used for temporary files during experiments.

## Requirements

- **DegScore**:  
  We rely on [DegScore](https://github.com/eternagame/DegScore) to provide a baseline and additional analytical tools for evaluating RNA degradation predictions.  
  Please follow the [DegScore installation instructions](https://github.com/eternagame/DegScore/blob/master/README.md) before running our code.

- **Arnie**:  
  [Arnie](https://github.com/DasLab/arnie) could be required for RNA secondary structure calculations and related preprocessing steps.  
  Install Arnie following the instructions in its repository.

## Running the Code

1. **Set up the environment**:  
   You can replicate the development environment used for this project by creating a new conda environment from the provided .yml file. Simply run:
```bash
conda env create -f cpsc583_final-project_environment.yml
conda activate cpsc583_environment
```

3. **Prepare data**:  
   Download and place all required data files into the `raw_data/` directory as described in `raw_data/README.md`.  
   Make sure the `train.json`, `test.json`, and related files from the Stanford COVID-19 Vaccine dataset are placed correctly.

4. **Model training and experiments**:  
   - For architecture comparisons, go to `architecture_experiments/` and run scripts such as `python baseline_gnn.py`.  
   - For hyperparameter optimization, navigate to `hyperparameter_optimization/` and run `python hyperparameter_optimization.py`.
   - For the primary model training script, run `python main.py`.
   - Check `results/` for output logs, best model checkpoints, and performance plots.

## Contributions

Our approach introduces:
- Pretraining with masked-language-modeling and link prediction on RNA graph representations.
- Advanced GNN architectures (e.g., TransformerConv layers and multi-head attention) applied directly to RNA secondary structures.
- A two-stage hybrid approach combining deep graph embeddings with classical ML methods (XGBoost).
